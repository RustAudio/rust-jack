//! Rust bindings for JACK, a real-time audio and midi library.
//!
//! # Server
//!
//! JACK provides a high priority server to manipulate audio and midi across applications. The rust
//! jack crate does not provide server creation functionality, so a server has to be set up with the
//! `jackd` commandline tool, `qjackctl` the gui tool, or another method.
//!
//! # Client
//!
//! Typically, applications connect clients to the server. For the rust jack crate, a connection can
//! be made with `client::Client::new`, which returns a `client::Client`.
//!
//! The `Client` can query the server for information, register ports, and manage connections for
//! ports.
//!
//! To commence processing audio/midi and other information in real-time, rust jack provides the
//! `Client::activate_async`, which consumes the `Client`, an object that implements
//! `NotificationHandler` and an object that implements `ProcessHandler` and returns a
//! `AsyncClient`. `AsyncClient` processes the data in real-time with the provided handlers.
//!
//! # Port
//!
//! A `Client` may obtain port information through the `Client::port_by_id` and
//! `Client::port_by_name` methods. These ports can be used to manage connections or to obtain port
//! metadata, though their port data (audio buffers and midi buffers) cannot be accessed safely.
//!
//! Ports can be registered with the `Client::register_port` method. This requires a `PortSpec`. The
//! jack crate comes with common specs such as `AudioIn`, `AudioOut`, `MidiIn`, and
//! `MidiOut`.
//!
//! To access the data of registered ports, use their specialized methods within a `ProcessHandler`
//! callback. For example, `Port<AudioIn>::as_mut_slice` returns a audio buffer that can be written
//! to.
